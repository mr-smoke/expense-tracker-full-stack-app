## About The Project

A full-stack expense tracker application built with React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, GraphQL, Passport, and Tailwind CSS. This project provides a platform for users to track their expenses, categorize them, and visualize their spending habits. It includes user authentication and authorization using Passport, allowing users to manage their own expenses while ensuring data privacy. The application leverages the power of React for building a dynamic and responsive user interface, MongoDB for a flexible and scalable database solution, Express.js for handling server-side logic and API endpoints, GraphQL for efficient data querying, and Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mr-smoke/expense-tracker-full-stack-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd expense-tracker-full-stack-app
   ```

3. Install the [dependencies](#dependencies) for the backend side:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables.

   ```bash
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

5. Start the backend side development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory in project:

   ```bash
   cd expense-tracker-full-stack-app/frontend
   ```

7. Install the [dependecies](#dependencies) for the frontend side:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

8. Start the frontend side development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Now both the backend side and frontend side servers should be running, and you can use the application.
